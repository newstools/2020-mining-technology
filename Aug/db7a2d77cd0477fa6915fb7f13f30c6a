Miner Elastomer Products has released a new technical paper from our engineering team regarding the effects of hysteresis on TecsPak. One key advantage with TecsPak is that like most rubbers and elastomers, we have hysteresis which provides a certain level of damping. In fact, compared to most elastomers, TecsPak has a greater amount of hysteresis. As is typical with most elastomers, when they are compressed there is internal friction that generates heat. This heat is energy that the bumper absorbs from the system. Subsequently, the return or release curve has a lower force. In comparison, a steel coil spring has no hysteresis. When the spring is compressed, it follows a linear line. Upon release, the load-deflection curve is the same line as compression. Typical TecsPak applications involve situations where the bumper is struck by a mass and is used to decelerate the moving object. The object rebounds and the bumper is reset for the next impact or cycle. However, there are many applications where the bumper is used in applications where the bumper is compressed before being further compressed. The compression can be achieved by either a static weight or by physically restraining the bumper at a height. The following is an explanation highlighting the factors to be considered in applying a TecsPak product for these types of applications.
