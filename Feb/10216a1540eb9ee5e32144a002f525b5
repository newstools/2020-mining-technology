Since Eurogomma started the business in 1975, our tensioned screens – in rubber and polyurethane – have always been our best sellers. One of the reason is that our tensioned screen panels have frequently evolved across the years to offer a constant improvement both in terms of efficiency and wear life. The time has come to renew our catalogue and give new relevance to a product that has characterized our history until now.
