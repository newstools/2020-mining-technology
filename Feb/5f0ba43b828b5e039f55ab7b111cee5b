Exploration, mining and mineral processing firm PT Agincourt Resources (PTAR) has selected Metso’s energy-efficient grinding technology for use at its Martabe gold mine in Sumatra, Indonesia. PTAR has chosen Metso’s Vertimill VTM-4500 stirred mill, which Metso claims is the largest to be installed in Indonesia. Metso noted that the machine is expected to be commissioned by July next year. PTAR operations director Darryn McClelland said: “PTAR worked with Orway Minerals on the circuit concept and with Ausenco on the process flowsheet design, and Metso won the competitive tender process for the additional milling capacity deemed a requirement from the process modelling. “Engagement with Metso in Indonesia supporting this work and their ability locally was also important when selecting the appropriate vendor.” The Metso Vertimill has been designed to deliver high energy efficiency and reduced media consumption. It also provides customers with low installation cost, and minimal liner wear and maintenance. Capable of handling feed sizes up to 6mm and grinding to products less than 20 microns, Metso Vertimill is available in standard mill sizes ranging from 15HP to 4,500HP.   The UK left the European Union on 31 January. Do you think this will be a positive or a negative for the UK mining industry?

The Martabe gold mine has utilised Metso crushers and additional equipment in their production process, and the Vertimill is an excellent choice for further increasing their comminution circuit’s output.” PTAR’s sole operating site is the Martabe gold mine. In August 2018, Australian private equity firm EMR Capital agreed to offload its 80% stake in the Martabe gold and silver mine to PT Danusa Tambang Nusantara for $1.21bn.
