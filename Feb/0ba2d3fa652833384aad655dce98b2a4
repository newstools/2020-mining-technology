Australian mining firm Roy Hill has signed a contract with mining equipment manufacturer Epiroc to automate the Western Australian iron ore miner’s mixed fleet of 77 Hitachi and Cat haul trucks. Along with partner and technology solutions provider ASI Mining, Epiroc will deliver an interoperable solution for Roy Hill’s fleet of trucks with the ability to expand to other mining vehicle types and manufacturers. The new solution by Epiroc and ASI Mining can also be integrated with existing and future Roy Hill systems. Under the contract, Epiroc and ASI Mining will work closely with Hitachi and Wencomine on truck conversion and integration of Roy Hill’s existing Wenco fleet management system. The project will see a phased implementation and involve an initial phase of testing and production verification of up to eight trucks. This phase will be implemented before the full fleet of the firm’s machines undergoes conversion from mid-next year. Roy Hill CEO Barry Fitzgerald said: “Our teams on-site and in our remote operations centre (ROC) in Perth have demonstrated a clear capacity to deliver complex projects, sustainable change and operational excellence with the recent success of the autonomous drill programme and fleet optimisation initiatives. “Now is the right time to bring the combined expertise of Roy Hill, Epiroc, ASI Mining and Wenco together to convert our haul truck fleet.”   The UK left the European Union on 31 January. Do you think this will be a positive or a negative for the UK mining industry?  View Results Roy Hill is an iron ore mining operation in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Its Perth-based ROC provides end-to-end integration of operations.
