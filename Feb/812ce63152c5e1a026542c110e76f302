 DSI Dry Fog systems can operate at all temperatures. The photo shown is an installation in a cement plant that can have temperatures down to -40°F/C. The system operates year-round using DSI’s unique heating system that has been tested down to these temperatures. Further, dry fog due to cloud physics can operate at the lowest temperatures with no ability to freeze in the air, similar to a cloud. This is not your standard water spray or misting system! Our solutions are also suitable for stack outs, ship loaders, truck loading silos and conveyor transfer points.
