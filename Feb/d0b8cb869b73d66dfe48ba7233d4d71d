Diversified natural resources company Teck Resources has revealed its plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. The announcement is part of the company’s commitment to climate action and the development of responsible resources. Teck’s target aligns with Canada and Chile’s commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050 and supports the transition towards a low-carbon economy. In order to achieve this, Teck will seek alternative methods of moving materials at its mines, using cleaner power sources, and start executing efficiency improvements. Teck Resources president and CEO Don Lindsay said: “Setting the objective to be carbon neutral by 2050 is an important step forward in our commitment to reducing emissions and taking action on climate change. “Climate change is a global challenge that our company and our industry need to contribute to solving. We will pursue the technologies and measures necessary to reduce carbon emissions across our business while continuing to responsibly provide the metals and minerals necessary for the world’s transition to a low-carbon economy.” The company also noted that it is investing in the metals required for the transition to a low-carbon economy, mainly through building the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 (QB2) copper project in Chile. Since the past few years, Teck has implemented several initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at its operations by more than 289,000t. In a separate statement, Teck announced the signing of a long-term power purchase agreement with its Chilean affiliates for the QB2 copper project. This agreement will replace QB2’s dependence on fossil fuel power sources and eliminate 800,000t of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions a year. Last month, Teck Resources acquired the SunMine solar energy facility in Kimberley, British Columbia (BC), Canada.
