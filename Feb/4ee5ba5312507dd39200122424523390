Mining contractor NRW Holdings has secured a bulk earthworks contract for the Iron Bridge magnetite project being developed by iron-ore major Fortescue Metals Group (FMG). Located 145km south of Port Hedland, the project is in the Pilbara region of Western Australia (WA). It involves new magnetite mine development and related infrastructure. The project is a joint venture (JV) between FMG subsidiary Iron Bridge and Formosa Steel IB. Under the contract, NRW will be responsible for the bulk earthworks and drainage for roads, processing plant and infrastructure. The A$70m ($47m) contract is expected to take place over a period of approximately 45 weeks. The project will attract around 200 site-based workers during its peak period and is being developed into a 22Mtpa operation, producing high-grade magnetite concentrate. The site comprises magnetite iron ore deposits, namely North Star, Eastern Limb, Glacier Valley and West Star. NRW CEO and managing director Jules Pemberton said: “NRW is pleased to be involved in this exciting new project with Fortescue and looks forward to its successful execution.” The magnetite project is expected to deliver the first ore in the first half of 2022. It has a mine life of more than 20 years. In April 2019, FMG and its joint venture partner Formosa Steel IB approved a $2.6bn development for the second stage of the Iron Bridge Magnetite project. Stage two follows a $500m investment in the first stage of development.
