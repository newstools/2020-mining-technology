The emergency response team (ERT) from Pybar Mining Services’ Henty gold mine in Australia has successfully retrieved the body of an employee, who had been missing since January 23. An earth collapse at the Tasmania gold mine trapped the mineworker underground last month. Following a lengthy search operation, the body of the worker was recovered yesterday. The mineworker was crushed by rock when he was driving a loader 700m underground at the Tasmanian gold mine, reported 7News. After securing approval from the coroner and regulator, limited operations started at another section of the gold mine. Operations at the Henty gold mine have been suspended since the worker was reported trapped. Pybar CEO Brendan Rouse said: “On behalf of all at Pybar, I express my deepest sympathies to Cameron’s family and gratitude to all on-site for their efforts in this recovery.”   The UK left the European Union on 31 January. Do you think this will be a positive or a negative for the UK mining industry?

It is an incredibly sad time for all people at the mine and in the community.” Rouse has also expressed relief that the ERT had recovered the worker’s body and praised all of them involved in the rescue operation. The company noted that it continues to provide counselling and support to employees affected by the incident. In January 2019, at least 30 people were killed and seven were injured due to the collapse of a gold mine in northern Afghanistan.
