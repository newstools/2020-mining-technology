The global economic growth in 2020 has been eclipsed since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak causing fears of looming unemployment and recession in a number of countries. Verdict has been tracking the optimism over global economic recovery through an online poll started in April and still ongoing in 22 of the network’s websites. Respondents have answered to how much time it would take for the global economy to recover post COVID-19, from four options to choose from – less than a year, one to three years, three to five years, and more than five years. Analysis of the poll results until the end of May shows that the optimism levels reached the lowest in two months, in the last week of May (25 to 31 May). Our parent business intelligence company The percentage of respondents who were optimistic about a recovery in less than one year decreased significantly from 20.6% in April to 11.8%, the lowest, in the last week of May.

Similarly, the percentage of respondents who voted that the recovery would take more than five years reached a high of 25.5% in the last week of May, compared to a low of 16.7% between 13 April and 19 April.

The significant fall in optimism could be attributed to downward revisions of economic growth forecasts in most of the major global economies in May, as below. S&P Global forecast in April that the global gross domestic product (GDP) will decline by 2.4% in 2020, but in May a number of organisations cut their 2020 growth forecast. The UN forecasts global GDP to contract by a steeper 3.2%, whereas the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects a 3% decline, as of May. Growth estimates for most of the top global economies have been revised downwards by leading rating agencies and financial institutions in May, compared to April, as below.
