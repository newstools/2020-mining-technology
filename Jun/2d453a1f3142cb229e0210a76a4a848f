KT-Infrastrukturgesellschaft GmbH & Co. KG is in the process of rebuilding the existing terminal in Wiener Straße in Regensburg and knew they could trust in Kuenz GmbH’s know-how in the intermodal crane industry. The project scope consists of a trimodal container gantry crane, featuring a telescopic spreader and gripping tongs. As the largest freight transport and cargo handling hub in all of Bavaria, the Bayernhafen Terminal will rely on first-class technology from Kuenz in order to increase overall efficiency for container movements for any rail, road, and water shipments as required. Project completion is scheduled for mid-2021.
