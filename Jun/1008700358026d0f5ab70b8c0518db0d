Magdeburger Förderanlagen und Baumaschinen GmbH, a global player, is gearing up for the future and has therefore been renamed into FAM GmbH, which was already widely used. Our company has been in existence for over 100 years and uses its powerful bucket wheel excavators, port facilities and transport technology in the field of raw material extraction, worldwide. We decided to change our name because FAM GmbH means simplifying our daily lives, especially in the increasingly international business. We now officially correspond to the already colloquial name FAM, which we have been identifying ourselves with for many years. FAM has gained a high reputation over the decades in Germany and abroad. We have preserved the Magdeburg tradition, but we are committed to progress. We have digitalised processes and are now ready for the challenges of the “new 20s” – as one of the world’s leading turnkey solutions providers of bulk material technology. We thank you for the trust you have placed in us and look forward to successful cooperation for years to come. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
