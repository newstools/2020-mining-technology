Canadian mineral exploration firm Oroco has completed its acquisition of the balance of ownership of Altamura Copper. Oroco now owns a 100% stake in Altamura and has outright control of the Santo Tomás porphyry copper project in north-western Mexico. Located in the northern state of Sinaloa in Mexico, the Santo Tomás deposit hosts a porphyry copper deposit comprised of fracture and disseminated copper and molybdenum sulphides, with significant gold and silver credits. As part of the acquisition, Oroco issued 39.8 million shares to Altamura shareholders. Oroco CEO Craig Dalziel said: “The Altamura acquisition completes a highly accretive process for Oroco and its shareholders. “We are now able to fully focus on the development of a significant geological asset which brings with it a very positive local community relationship; exceptional supporting infrastructure; an eager and capable local workforce; and clearly supportive local, regional and federal government agencies. “The future for Santo Tomás and the surrounding communities is very bright.”   Is investing heavily in battery minerals a risk given the pace of EV technology change?
