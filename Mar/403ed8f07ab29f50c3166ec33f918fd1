McElroy brings productivity improvements and exciting new features to the DataLogger 6 that allow users to document and analyse even more of their job sites. These groundbreaking enhancements in Version 1.15 include McElroy Optimized Cooling™, which reduces the minimum cool time based on a new, patent-pending formula that is compliant with ASTM F2620. In addition, this update includes the ability to capture pressure tests in the field. McElroy conducted extensive testing and even partnered with the University of Tulsa on the procedures for cooling — the longest step in the fusion process — to determine the appropriate amount of time it takes to cool the centre of the pipe. “As a manufacturer, we have always looked at ways to optimize our equipment and now we’re optimizing the fusion procedure itself,” said Jim Johnston, Chief Innovation Officer at McElroy. The cool time can be reduced with McElroy Optimized Cooling based on a formula that includes the ambient temperature, pipe temperature, weather conditions, heat soak time and pipe wall thickness for each joint. This procedure results in dramatic time savings for the entire fusion process by saving days and even weeks on the job. “This will be very useful for our customers who value productivity and would like to increase their output,” Johnston added. Up until now, most pressure tests done in the field have either been monitored and recorded manually or have used antiquated technologies. The DataLogger 6 now offers a guided workflow to document the details of pressure tests along with a digital graph of the process. These test reports will also be stored along with all of the joint reports from job sites in the McElroy Vault™. This information is backed up, safe and provides a complete report of the job.
