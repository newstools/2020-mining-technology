We are ready to do our part in keeping these vital sectors fully operational in this challenging time. “Currently, we are not experiencing infrastructure or supply chain issues that could impact the fulfilment of customer orders due to our local manufacturing capabilities. “We continue to monitor this extremely fluid and unprecedented situation and will keep our customers informed of any updates or changes. We wish everyone across Australia continued good health during these unprecedented times.”
