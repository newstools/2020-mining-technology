Gold mining firm Newmont Corporation has signed a contract with Australian technology company K2fly to implement K2fly’s resource governance solution, RCubed. K2fly will deploy the RCubed resource governance solution for Newmont’s global mine operations. The RCubed solution will capture and report resource and reserve data from Newmont’s 12 gold mines, other joint ventures and global projects. The three-year software as a service contract is expected to generate revenue of more than A$900,000 ($585,728). K2fly chief commercial officer Nic Pollock said: “Our gold resource reporting template is increasingly becoming the industry standard, and we can now proudly lay claim to our RCubed resource governance solution being used by four of the top ten gold miners globally: Newmont, Anglo Gold Ashanti, Newcrest and Gold Fields.” Furthermore, K2fly was present at the recent Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) 2020 Conference in Toronto, Canada. Following this convention, the technology firm received interest from three other gold mining companies.   Is investing heavily in battery minerals a risk given the pace of EV technology change?

Last month, Newmont announced that its Boddington mine in Western Australia is set to become the world’s first autonomous gold mine once it becomes fully operational.
