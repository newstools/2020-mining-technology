Newmont Corporation has completed the sale of its 19.9% equity stake in Continental Gold, as part of the Chinese firm Zijin Mining’s C$1.4bn ($1.05bn) acquisition of Continental Gold, for a cash consideration of $260m. Newmont noted that the sale was part of a contractual arrangement to support Zijin Mining’s acquisition of Continental. This transaction also marks the closing of Zijin Mining’s acquisition of Continental Gold. In December last year, Zijin Mining signed a definitive agreement to acquire Continental Gold, pursuant to which Zijin Mining agreed to buy all of the outstanding shares of Continental Gold at C$5.50 ($4.14) a share. Newmont president and CEO Tom Palmer said: “Selling our Continental stake into a strong bid allowed us to generate $260m in cash that will support our disciplined approach to capital allocation, including strengthening our investment grade balance sheet, investing in our highest returning projects, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. “Combined with the sale of our interests in Continental and KCGM, once we complete the sale of Red Lake this quarter, we will have generated more than $1.4 billion in asset sales in less than a year since closing the Goldcorp acquisition last April.” Last month, China’s Zijin Mining received approval from the Canadian Investment Canada Act to acquire a 100% equity interest in mining firm Continental Gold for C$1.33bn ($996m).   The UK left the European Union on 31 January. Do you think this will be a positive or a negative for the UK mining industry?
