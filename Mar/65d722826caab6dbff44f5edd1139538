Canadian miner First Quantum Minerals is reportedly considering the sale of a minority stake in its flagship Cobre Panama copper mine to reduce the company’s debt. Reuters, quoting two banking sources familiar with the discussions, reported the miner’s possible move comes at a time when mining firms across the world are struggling to boost finances amid the coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic, which has tumbled stocks as well as copper prices. According to the firm, it has invested a total of $6.3bn in Cobre Panama up to last year. First Quantum has a market capitalisation of $2.4bn. It trades around three times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to Reuters. At the end of 2019 its net debt stood at $8.8bn. The firm will be required to do more than refinance its loan after discussions to divest its Zambian mines halted due to the Covid-19 outbreak, a source said. Cobre Panama, with a 40-year mine life, has proven copper reserves of 3.18 billion tonnes. First Quantum has a 90% stake in the mine.   How concerned are you about spread of Coronavirus?
