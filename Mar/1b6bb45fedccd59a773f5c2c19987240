Rolls-Royce has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with ASI Mining to offer autonomous-compatible, Mobius-ready MTU engine solutions for equipment across a wider range of mining applications. ASI Mining has agreed to ensure the compatibility of MTU engines and ASI’s Mobius command and control software for autonomous vehicles. Rolls-Royce business unit Power Systems, through its brand MTU, and ASI Mining intend to combine their expertise to offer engine solutions that are compatible with ASI’s vehicle automation software. These engine solutions will enable the optimisation of vehicle power performance and efficiency, thereby creating safer mining operations, according to the two companies.. Rolls-Royce Power Systems Mining and Oil & Gas global director Scott Woodruff said: “We are excited to shape the mining industry’s future together with ASI and further leverage our advanced MTU technologies. Together we will offer our customers integrated future-oriented autonomous solutions. “This agreement may help mining operators save big on operational costs and at the same time, reduce their environmental footprint by cutting emissions.” Customers will have the ability to retrofit the power system on existing haul trucks in order to convert them to autonomous operations.   Is investing heavily in battery minerals a risk given the pace of EV technology change?  View Results ASI Mining Business Development director Drew Larsen said: “We are excited to start these discussions with Rolls-Royce Power Systems. This is another testament to the interoperability of Mobius and real value it adds to our mining customers.” In November last year, ASI Mining started work at the Ferrexpo Yeristovo Mine (FYM) in Ukraine to retrofit its haul truck fleet with automation technology.
