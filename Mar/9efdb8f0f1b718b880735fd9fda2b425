EXAIR’s latest product, the 1/8 No Drip Internal Mix Air Atomizing Spray Nozzles, mix liquid and air inside the nozzle to produce the finest atomisation of liquids. The patented No Drip Internal Mix Atomizing Spray Nozzles work in the same way as EXAIR’s standard atomising nozzles but have the added benefit of positively stopping liquid flow when compressed air is shut off. When spraying any type of liquid, post-spray liquid flow can cause big problems. Drips occurring after spraying waste precious resources such as expensive coatings, chemicals or water, and are now eliminated with EXAIR’s patented design. Unwanted drips can ruin product function on sealing or mating surfaces and can ruin the appearance of painted or coated finishes. EXAIR’s No Drip Air Atomizing Nozzles are ideal where no post-spray drip is permissible. When the compressed air supply is shut off, the no-drip nozzle positively seals off the flow of liquid eliminating the possibility of drips. The EXAIR 1/8 No Drip Internal Mix Atomizing Nozzles are available in three different liquid patterns: narrow-angle round, wide-angle round and flat fan patterns. No Drip Internal Mix atomizing nozzles are available with 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 inlets with a variety of liquid flow values to suit your application. They are for pressure fed applications where accurate liquid flow is needed. Internal mix nozzles can be used on liquids with a viscosity up to 300 centipoise. Applications include painting, coating, rinsing, cooling, quenching, wetting (moistening), dust control and humidification. The compact atomising nozzles are fully adjustable to match your application’s liquid requirements and have interchangeable liquid and air caps. They are CE compliant and conflict mineral free.
