Exploration company West African Resources has poured first gold at its Sanbrado project in Burkina Faso, West Africa. The first smelt exercise at the mine delivered gold bars weighing 23.9kg. West African completed construction and commissioning activities in all areas, passing three million working hours without a lost time injury (LTI). It has processed 75,000 tonnes of ore grading 1.5 grams per tonne (g/t) of gold through the Sanbrado plant, exceeding nameplate capacity in mill throughput. West African executive chairman Richard Hyde said: “This is a major milestone for West African Resources and marks the beginning of a new phase in the West African story. To successfully transition from an exploration company to a gold producer is without doubt a great achievement for all involved. “I would like to thank West African’s owners’ team and all consultants, contractors and other stakeholders for their hard work and support over the last four years to bring Sanbrado from discovery into production.” The company noted that open pit mining at Sanbrado has scaled up activity at both the M5 and M1 South pits.
