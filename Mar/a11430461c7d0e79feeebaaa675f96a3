DEZEGA has signed a contract with the MossIA ANS joint venture to supply DEZEGA SCSRs for the construction of a railway between Sandbukta, Moss and Såstad in Norway. Norwegian state-owned company Bane NOR is overseeing the construction project as part of its InterCity plan to promote connections between cities in Norway and reduce traffic congestion in the capital, Oslo, and the surrounding area. The estimated cost of the project is €650m. MossIA ANS is a joint venture of Implenia Norway and Acciona Construction. Implenia Norway is a part of Implenia Group, a supplier of construction and civil engineering services in Switzerland. Acciona Construction is a Spanish conglomerate, specialising in the construction of railways and tunnels. The DEZEGA 1PVM KS self-contained self-rescuer will be used during the construction of the tunnels. 1PVM KS is a lightweight, reliable and easy-to-use device with a working duration of an hour. It takes little time to put on in the event of an emergency and allows users to breathe in low or no-oxygen environments. Modifications of 1PVM KS self-rescuer are certified in Europe, South Africa, India and Ukraine. It is used in more than 10 countries worldwide. DEZEGA business development director Yuriy Spivak said: “DEZEGA has proven itself as a reliable safety-company in the mining sector. We are proud that our brand is associated with safety. We do not stop on achieved, we develop new markets, sectors, projects. MossIA ANS is one more in our piggy bank of DEZEGA tunnelling projects. By the way, our Company already has several large-scale tunnelling projects in different parts of the world: BBT (between Austria and Italy), IDRIS in Qatar, Rosenstein Tunnel in Germany and several projects in Scandinavian countries and in Hong Kong.” The company will continue to supply equipment for the project until all phases of construction are complete, currently scheduled for 2025.
