Gold exploration and development firm Newcrest Mining has finalised the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary Newcrest Singapore Holdings (NSH) to Indotan Halmahera Bangkit. NSH holds a 75% interest in PT Nusa Halmahera Minerals (PT NHM), which owns and operates the Gosowong mine in Indonesia. Newcrest said in a press statement: “The sale of NSH follows a strategic review of the asset by Newcrest and to comply with the amended PT NHM Contract of Work which required at least 51% of PT NHM to be owned by Indonesian parties by 30 June 2020.” The transaction will allow Indotan to acquire Newcrest’s 75% stake in the Gosowong mine for a total of $90m. Newcrest noted that it has already received $60m from the sale. Indotan will pay the remaining $30m within 18 months. Newcrest expects a $44m loss upon divestment of its interest in PT NHM. The agreement to sell NSH was initially signed in January this year.   The UK left the European Union on 31 January. Do you think this will be a positive or a negative for the UK mining industry?
