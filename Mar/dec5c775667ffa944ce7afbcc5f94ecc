The Indian parliament has passed a bill that will open the coal sector fully for commercial mining for all domestic and international mining companies. The Mineral laws (Amendment) bill also proposes the removal of end-use restrictions to the mining companies for participation in coal mine auctions. According to PTI, the Mineral laws (Amendment) Bill was passed in Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India, with 83 members voting in its favour and only 12 against the law. India Coal and Mines Minister Prahlad Joshi said: “We have to produce coal and reduce imports.” He said that the legislation is expected to bring a ‘sea change’ in the coal mining sector and noted that the focus should be on exploring reserves without harming the environment. Joshi assured MPs that the government will strengthen the state-owned Coal India Limited (CIL). Joshi said: “CIL will be strengthened. I have already given it a target to produce one billion tonnes by 2023-24…There will be no problem in CIL.”   How concerned are you about spread of Coronavirus?
