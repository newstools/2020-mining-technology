Anglo American has reported that rough diamond sales at its majority-owned subsidiary De Beers declined 28% during the second sales cycle of 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The company sold $355m of rough diamonds in the second cycle of the year, compared with $496m for the same period in 2019. Proceeds from the second sales cycle of 2020 were 36% lower than January’s $551m.

De Beers, which holds 12 sales cycles a year for its rough diamonds, last month said that rough diamond production decreased by 13% to 30.8 million carats in 2019, compared to 35.3 million carats in 2018, primarily driven by a reduction in South Africa. The company said that while trading conditions have improved since the third quarter of 2019, production was lower in response to softer rough diamond demand conditions compared with 2018.
