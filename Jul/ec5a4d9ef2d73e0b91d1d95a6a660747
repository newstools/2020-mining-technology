Fertiliser and chemical giant CSBP limited, a part of the Wesfarmers group, recently installed 11 large Fabric Shelters by DomeShelter Australia as temporary warehouses for stock in transit. The Fabric Shelters mounted on standard 40ft sea containers are all interconnected with water management systems, lighting, end walls and doors. The doors were specially engineered to cater to the high wind coastal region the shelters are located in at the Kwinana industrial area, south of Perth. Working closely with their client CSBP, the team at DomeShelter Australia designed and engineered the 11 Fabric Structures to meet the exacting needs of their client. Shelters were all pre-fabricated off-site and delivered in kit form to the Kwinana site. Installation by a team of three took place over just three weeks. Traditional steel sheds were considered as an alternative, but the benefits of the DomeShelter™ Fabric Structures were a major consideration in the final decision to use them. DomeShelter™ Fabric Structures are delivered in kit form all over the world and are highly popular on mining and industrial sites for workshops and warehousing and as an alternative to steel sheds
