With depleting metal ore reserves and finely dispersed ore bodies, fine grinding has become an integral part of mineral processing circuits. In the past seven years, Outotec HIG mills have been marketed, tested, sold and commissioned for a number of projects worldwide in a wide range of applications and mill sizes, including the world’s highest power regrind / fine grinding / stirred mills. During this webinar, our speakers Riddhika Jain, Product Manager, and Bjorn Nielsen, Director, Product Management Grinding will discuss how the HIGmill optimizes grinding efficiency and maximizes operating profitability and will share cases of projects where significant economic and environmental benefits were achieved
