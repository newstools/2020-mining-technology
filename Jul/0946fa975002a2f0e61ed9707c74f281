 It was exactly one year ago when we told our followers about our first Superflexy screen in France for the classification of municipal solid waste clinker. The installation has been extremely successful and has led to two new orders in France for the same application: SF 1500×5670/18, near the city of Chartres
Processed material: Municipal Solid Waste Clinker 0 – 35 mm at 70 t/h; Cut at 8 mm
Out : 0 – 8 mm (75%) ; 8 – 30 mm (25%)
First run in October 2020 SF 1200×4725/15, near the city of Caen
Material in: Municipal Solid Waste Clinker 0 – 35 mm at 50 t/h; Cut at 8 mm
