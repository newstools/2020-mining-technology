Fine screening is a typical application for stainless steel wire meshes. Efficiency is high but the wear life of the screen meshes is a real nightmare. The replacements are so frequent that the process is economically affected because of the numerous shutdowns. Eurogomma has been working in this environment for years offering polyurethane screen panels instead of wire meshes. What is new now is the opportunity to install our self-supporting screen panels on your deck even in fine screening. This may not sound like a big improvement but on several occasions, the decks for fine screening are made of a very light metal frame. In those cases, the usage of self-supporting polyurethane screening panels makes the difference so to offer long life and high efficiency also in fine screening.
