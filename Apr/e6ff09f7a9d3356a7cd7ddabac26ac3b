Global gold mining company AngloGold Ashanti has made two of its mining hospitals available to the South African provincial governments of North West and Gauteng as the country battles the coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic. The facilities will be used for the treatment and isolation of Covid-19 patients. The first facility is a fully-equipped, 270-bed hospital near Orkney in the North West province. The second is a hospital building in western Gauteng that the company had previously closed in a restructuring of its South African activities. The building has capacity for 300 beds and the Gauteng Department of Health is working to ensure it is fully equipped and recommissioned in the coming weeks. AngloGold Ashanti vice president for health Dr Bafedile Chauke said: “The provincial health teams have worked with incredible diligence to ensure these facilities are made available to serve the public. We’re pleased to work alongside the authorities in this national effort.” The company is also providing other forms of support to the nation’s efforts against the virus and is working with partners to distribute 5,000 care parcels containing groceries, handwash and other essentials to the elderly and vulnerable. AngloGold Ashanti has also made available freestanding 1,000 litre water tanks used for handwashing, which have been in use at their mining operations. The company is working with authorities to distribute the tanks to areas that may not have sufficient water networks. AngloGold has also pledged ZAR20m ($1m) to the Solidarity Response Fund, an independent initiative backed by the South African government to support the healthcare sector in efforts to suppress the spread of the virus.
