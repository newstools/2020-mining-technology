There are two major components of a wind fence, the support structure and the netting. The lifespan of a support structure can vary depending on what materials are used i.e. wood versus metal posts. Our netting is rated for 20,000 hours of tropical UV light resistance. In a sunny climate such as southern Alberta, this works out to about 12 years, however, we have many fences where the netting lasts much longer. How much wind can we expect a wind fence to stop? The 1070 screen [our most popular netting material product] will stop up to 60% of the wind. Why donâ€™t your windscreens block more than just 60% of the wind? If you block more than 73% of the wind, you create a backdraft which in turn creates swirling and can actually make the problem worse. 60% wind reduction is the optimal target. What is the cost of installed fences? Providing an exact cost is not possible without being provided with some basic information such as install location, soil conditions, availability of concrete and man lift equipment. Most fences can be quoted after you provide some basic information and our wind fences are installed in 5in increments. How big will my fence need to be? This will depend on your unique circumstances. How big is the area you are trying to protect? What height are you trying to protect? How far away will the fence be installed from that area? Each site has unique needs which are why our installation experts work closely with you during the design phase. Why do I need a wind fence? A wind fence provides many benefits. First, it improves the environment for working staff and neighbouring communities by reducing the transmission of dust, litter, and noises. It also provides cost savings by reducing stockpile waste. Structures are also protected from heavy winds. What is the maintenance of the fence? Our wind fences are designed to be virtually zero maintenance. Once the netting has reached the end of its intended life span, it can be replaced very easily.
