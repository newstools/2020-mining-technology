MachineMax and Truphone announce its partnership to roll out its cutting-edge eSIM technology across the business. MachineMax provides sensor devices for off-highway heavy equipment users to maximise the productivity of every machine in their fleet. By implementing Truphone’s state-of-the-art eSIM technology to its devices, MachineMax will now benefit from global connectivity straight out of the box. What’s more, every eSIM profile in MachineMax’s fleet can now be updated and connected remotely and at scale from the Truphone for Things platform—enabling users to deploy and manage connectivity for thousands of devices at the touch of a button. As an intrinsically global company, MachineMax needed a connectivity provider that could meet their international requirements. Truphone’s network supports 2G, 3G, 4G and CAT-M1/LTE-M worldwide, all with a single SIM card, and its simple pre-paid plans are flexible, dependent on our user’s specific global footprint. MachineMax CEO ‍Amit Rai said: “Our exciting partnership with Truphone brings global connectivity to our award-winning offering, providing our customers with a superior experience and complete peace of mind to track their entire global fleet at the touch of a button. “That’s 24/7 coverage of their machines, no matter the site size or manufacturer, we really can track them all. With the support of Truphone, we are confident we can continue our rapid global expansion whilst providing seamless global connectivity.” Truphone CEO ‍Ralph Steffens said: “We developed our Truphone for Things platform to simplify the whole process of onboarding, managing and using IoT connectivity for companies exactly like MachineMax—who want their devices to just connect – and work – instantly, out of the box. All too often, we think of the IoT as this complex, futuristic technology, when the truth is—IoT is now, and, with Truphone, IoT is simple.”
