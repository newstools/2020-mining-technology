Learning knows no bounds at McElroy University. For a limited time, you can still receive training directly from the fusion experts with our new online learning series! We have taken all of our online, self-paced learning modules and created three bundles that we are making available for limited time at a special price. Students normally take these online modules as part of their qualification training at a significantly higher rate, but we are currently offering you special access to these bundles for just $25 each: POLYETHYLENE – This includes an introduction to PE pipe and pipe fusion, socket fusion, saddle fusion, manual butt fusion and hydraulic butt fusion. POLYPROPYLENE — Includes an introduction to PP pipe and pipe fusion, socket fusion, outlet fusion, butt fusion with the Acrobat™ and butt fusion with the Polygon™. DATALOGGER®— DataLogger 6 operations, using the DataLogger with manual butt fusion and DataLogger 6 updates. While fusion certification, which requires hands-on time in the shop, is facing new challenges, now’s the perfect time to boost your classroom knowledge. If you want to sign up for a full qualification class at a later time, you’ll already have a head-start on your training! Don’t miss your opportunity to gain special access to this information during this limited timeframe. Once you register or sign-in, you will be directed to the McElroy University online learning portal. Add any or all bundles to your cart, checkout and start learning!
