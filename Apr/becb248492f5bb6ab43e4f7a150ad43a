Canadian miner Yamana Gold has signed an agreement to sell shares and warrants in Vancouver-headquartered Equinox Gold for C$201m (approximately $144m). The company agreed the deal with Stifel GMP and Cormark Securities to sell 12 million units priced at C$10 ($7.17) each. Each unit consists of one common share of Equinox Gold owned by Yamana and one-half of a purchase warrant of Yamana. According to Yamana, if all warrants are exercised, gross proceeds to Yamana would total C$201m (approximately $144m). Stifel and Cormark have committed to purchase from Yamana any unsold units for C$10 ($7.17) each on closing, which is subject to customary conditions for “bought deal” financings. Prior to the sale, Yamana held 19.2 million Equinox shares, which represents an 8.91% stake, and warrants to acquire 8.3 million Equinox shares, representing 3.86% of outstanding shares. The transaction is scheduled to close on 15 April.   How concerned are you about spread of Coronavirus?
