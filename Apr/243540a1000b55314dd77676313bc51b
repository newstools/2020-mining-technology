To provide increased support for customers and projects throughout the state, intelligent positioning solutions provider Position Partners has expanded its geographic reach throughout the state of Queensland. Employees based in Townsville, Chinchilla and Mackay are on-hand to support customers with technical advice, support and installations, calling on the larger Brisbane-based team as required to offer customers full-service capabilities. “We are pleased to announce these changes to give customers throughout the state local support,” said Harry Katsanevas, Queensland Regional Manager at Position Partners. Position Partners offers sales, rental, service and training across its range of civil machine control, GPS and surveying technology, mining fleet management and high precision machine guidance systems. Mr Katsanevas said: “Our Queensland team includes some of our most experienced and capable people across the whole company, with extensive knowledge not only of the technology but also our customers and the work they do. “As the leader for our Queensland region I have one focus, and that is ensuring every aspect of our business is channelled towards our customers and doing everything possible to keep them working as productively as possible.” With dedicated teams for civil construction, mining and geospatial customers, Mr Katsanevas said that Queensland employees bring industry-focused expertise whilst working collaboratively across the business to meet the needs of customers. “Our award-winning remote service platform Tokara is one example of a technology that’s been built by our team from the ground up and works across all industries we serve,” he said. “Our service centres can repair and calibrate everything from a laser level through to survey drones, machine control systems and total stations. We also have applications specialists in areas such as on-board weighing, mass haul scheduling and more that can be called on across all market segments as required.”
