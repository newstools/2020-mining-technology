In the mining sector, adaptive capabilities are at the core of mining innovation, with targeted advancements supporting the industry’s continued success and the ongoing viability of mining sites. In Australia, the mining sector is relatively mature, with companies becoming increasingly proficient in systematically addressing challenges, reducing costs, minimising risks and improving efficiencies. Such proactive action is, of course, crucial in protecting the industry’s future prosperity. Accommodating the ever-changing needs of those in the mining sector, battery technology is constantly evolving and advancing. This translates into lower maintenance costs, a reduction in emissions and improved durability (which equates to a lower Total Cost of Ownership). Equipped with durable, robust batteries that deliver superior performance and ultimate cranking power, your heavy-duty vehicles will be built for continued success in harsh mining environments. All of this draws on the battery and, if you don’t have a powerful solution, your workers will likely be disadvantaged, negatively impacting the effectiveness of your operations.
