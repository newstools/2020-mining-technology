For the first time, Tekne arrives in Oceania, with three large industrial vehicles destined for the mines of New Caledonia. Three body versions with different capacities up to 53ton of the five axles. All the outfits are equipped with anti-crushing safety systems and innovative systems for service braking. They have started their long journey and we will see them in action soon!
