A light vehicle is forced to stop on the side of the road to do a ‘forced regeneration’ on its diesel particulate filter (DPF). That can take up to 40 minutes to complete. Now, what if that’s a workshop vehicle on its way to repair a Haul Truck, or replace a hose on a shovel? What is the 40 mins downtime costing you now? What if it happens to stop on a haul road? Does that then become a safety matter? You can change out that expensive DPF again and again, but it does absolutely nothing to address the actual cause of the problem. In fact, it’s likely to become more frequent, because internal engine deposits will also be increasing. Most operations just accept DPF issues as a necessary expense, but you don’t have to. The real fix is low cost, and very easy. And, there’s zero downtime. It reduces the production of soot, which is the root cause of the DPF problem. It also prevents it from ever happening again. Diesel treated with FTC / FPC Decarbonizer totally eliminates DPF problems. Light vehicle fleets with horrendous, ongoing DPF problems, have eliminated regen problems with FTC / FPC Decarbonizer.
