Chinese miner Chifeng Jilong Gold Mining has started processing gold ore from its Sepon mine in Laos three months ahead of schedule, despite the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. This marks the first time the project has produced gold in almost six and a half years, Reuters reported. Located in the south of Laos in Savannakhet Province, Sepon mine is an open pit operation. According to the news agency, the Covid-19 outbreak has prompted investors to pile into the precious metal, usually seen as a safe-haven investment during tumultuous times.

Global resources firm MMG, the previous owner of the Sepon copper and gold mine, had ceased the mine’s gold operations in December 2013 due to depleting ore reserves and lower margins. In 2018, the Chinese firm bought a 90% stake in the Sepon mine owner Lane Xang Minerals from MMG for $275m.

He added that the firm also plans to produce 45,000t of copper this year, an estimate down from 72,000t last year.
