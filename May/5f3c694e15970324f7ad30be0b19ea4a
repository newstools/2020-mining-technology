EXAIR’s 1/2in No Drip External Mix Air Atomizing Spray Nozzles work in the same way their standard atomizing nozzles do but have the added benefit of positively stopping liquid flow when compressed air is shut off. External Mix Air Atomizing Spray Nozzles have the highest flow rates and allow the air and liquid flow to be adjusted independently. They can be used on liquids above 300 centipoise. The patented No Drip design requires no additional air line to control the No Drip feature. Like any of EXAIR’s spray nozzles, these are ideal for sanitisation, decontamination, cooling, cleaning, dust mitigation, coating or humidification. When spraying any type of liquid, post-spray drips can cause big problems. Unwanted drips can ruin product function on sealing or mating surfaces and ruin painted or coated finishes. Also, excess liquid flow wastes resources such as expensive coatings, chemicals or water. When the compressed air supply is shut off, the no-drip nozzle positively seals off the flow of liquid eliminating the possibility of drips. 1/2in No Drip External Mix Atomizing Nozzles are available in a narrow-angle flat fan pattern. They are for pressure fed applications with independent air and liquid control. Available from Compressed Air Australia, the No Drip and standard Atomizing Nozzles are fully adjustable to minimise air and liquid consumption and have interchangeable liquid and air caps. Flow ranges from 534Lph to 1,147Lph (141Gph to 303Gph). They are also available in 1/8in and 1/4in sizes and are CE compliant and conflict mineral free.
