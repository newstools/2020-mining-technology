Axora, an innovation hub for digital solutions, has launched an online smart mining resource centre to help mining companies recover after the global Covid-19 pandemic. The smart mining resource centre provides industry insights and access to digital solutions and technologies which mining companies can adopt to accelerate their business growth, reduce wasted investment, and avoid duplication. Axora chief commercial officer Dr Nick Mayhew said: “The downtime caused by Covid-19 offers mining companies a unique opportunity to improve their digital solutions, accelerate their digital transformation roadmaps, and enable ‘smart mining’. The companies that use this moment to push themselves to make their mines smarter are the ones which will recover the quickest and thrive in the future. “The Covid-19 pandemic is causing an acceleration of digital transformation across the mining sector, as the need to be safer, more sustainable and more efficient has never been greater.” Our parent business intelligence company Axora’s smart mining digital solutions include three types of technology: smart devices; smart connected devices; and IoT, which can assist mining companies in the post-Covid-19 world. The company is also launching a survey aimed at investigating the impact of Covid-19 on digital innovation and home-working practices in the mining industry. Axora uses blockchain technology to currently host more than 120 digital solutions for sector leaders, start-ups, universities, and consultancies.   Given the current climate, how long do you anticipate it will take for the global economy to recover post COVID-19?  View Results
