When it was discovered on a recent project that major fasteners on a supplied piece of OEM equipment could not be installed, M2P was able to quickly design and draft custom studs, working with local manufacturers to get items on-site within 6 days, allowing the equipment install to proceed and the project schedule to be maintained. M2Ps in-house design and engineering capabilities along with our ability to identify and work with exceptional local suppliers ensure that your project gets delivered on time, and on schedule, no matter the hurdles on the way. M2Pâ€™s inflatable Minvent products save time and money, whilst improving safety on-site. M2P manufactures customisable inflatable products for a wide range of industry applications, which are designed to operate at various temperatures and pressures.
