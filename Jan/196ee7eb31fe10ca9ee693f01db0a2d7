EXAIRâ€™s new Gen4 Two Outlet Selectable Voltage Power Supply allows you to choose input voltages of 115V AC or 230V AC. Two 5kV stainless-steel output connectors can energise two static eliminators. Applications using up to two Gen4 Super Ion Air Knives, Ion Air Guns, Ion Air Cannons, Ionizing Bars or any other EXAIR Gen4 Static Eliminator product can be connected to one power supply. Similar to all EXAIR Gen4 products, these two outlet power supplies are UL component recognised, CE and RoHS compliant. They also feature an electromagnetically shielded modular power supply cable, which eases routing and connections. An integrated fuse on the primary protects against voltage spikes. The lighted power switch indicates operation and is field replaceable. Available from Compressed Air Australia, the Gen4 Two Outlet Power Supply is housed in a durable metal enclosure (140mm L x 102mm W x 26mm H) that is ideal for rugged, industrial environments. Gen4 Static Eliminators have a bayonet-style connector that can be inserted into the power supply where the electrical connection is made deep inside to prevent a shock hazard. Gen4 Static Eliminator products for the power supply are all shockless and have armoured high-voltage cables, which resist abrasion and cuts.
