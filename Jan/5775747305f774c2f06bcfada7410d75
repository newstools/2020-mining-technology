Nevada Copper has selected mining contractor Redpath USA to implement its enhancement strategy for its 100% owned Pumpkin Hollow project in Nevada, US. Going forward, Redpath will serve as the company’s principal underground mining contractor, said Nevada Copper. Pumpkin Hollow project is an underground copper mine and a large-scale open-pit development with a number of exploration hotspots. Located in Yerington, the copper mine has a project life of 23 years. With the commencement of production at Pumpkin Hollow’s processing plant last month, Nevada Copper entered a new era of the development phase. Nevada Copper CEO Matt Gili stated: “Nevada Copper made the transition to producer in Q4 2019 and we have developed a clear, straightforward strategy for ramping up our Pumpkin Hollow underground project to full commercial production. “Redpath is considered throughout the mining industry as the partner of choice for production ramp-up and we are excited to be working with them during this important period of growth.” Nevada Copper began construction of the Pumpkin Hollow mine in August 2018. In January, the company filed a technical report and later signed a series of agreements with KfW IPEX-Bank and Concord Resources to finance the project. It signed a $115m credit agreement with KfW IPEX-Bank and a $35m working capital facility with Concord Resources. Other offtake agreements were signed with Aurubis, Aurubis Bulgaria, and Concord. Aiming to make new discoveries, exploration is currently underway at the Pumpkin Hollow greenfield mine.
