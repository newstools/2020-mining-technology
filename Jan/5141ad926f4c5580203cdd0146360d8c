Canadian junior gold mining company Jaguar Mining has resumed its growth exploration drilling activities at Turmalina Mine Operation, one of its Brazilian gold mines. The company confirmed today that in 2020 growth exploration will resume through an underground diamond rig operated by Major Drilling. Jaguar Mining CEO Vern Baker said that the resumption of growth exploration drilling in Turmalina was an important step in the company’s solidification of operations in Brazil’s Iron Quadrangle – a mineral-rich region, known for its extensive deposits of gold and diamonds. Baker said: “With a sustained four-year reserve inventory underpinning the company’s planned production at current mining rates going forward, this growth exploration cycle will focus on adding new, high-quality mineral resource and mineral reserve ounces contiguous with existing mining infrastructure while leveraging existing excess plant capacity.” Jaguar Mining management committee expert advisor for geology and exploration Jon Hill added that due to the previous years’ investments in growth exploration, this new cycle will focus instead on targeting new, near-term growth opportunities, which are recently-discovered or recognised, or under-explored areas. Hill said: “The benefits of this approach are proven, and we expect to once again deliver material value to Jaguar via strong, researched drill programmes supported by a successful and highly motivated team.” The company also released its drilling results which confirmed the model grades and thickness of the main orebodies, orebody A and C. According to the data, 11 infill drilling intersections have reported 15.22 grams per tonne gold (g/t Au) over 8.36 metres in one orebody, while 8.02 g/t Au over 7.66 metres in the other.
